# Live Share Emoji

Live Share Pomodoro enhances the existing [Visual Studio Live Share](https://aka.ms/vsls) experience, by enabling you to use the [Pomodoro technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) for time management within collaboration sessions. All participants within the session work against the same synchronized timer, and can stop and reset it collaboratively. For certain use cases (e.g. pair programming), this can provide a useful means of adding structure to the Live Share session (e.g. enforcing when to take breaks, providing a moment to switch roles), without needing to rely on a seperate tool or individual preference.
